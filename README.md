The Innovations Lab Kosovo has collaborated with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) to identify several challenges in delivering education services to the youth of Kosovo. A seemingly minor issue, yet one that has significant impact not only to local youth but also to international students and interested partners for collaboration, is the challenge of finding officially-validated information about higher education institutions in Kosovo. Ushahidi platform was adapted to allow each institution to have a profile that is categorized using standard MEST categories, and map the institutionâ€™s locations. We identified several modifications and improvements to Ushahidi necessary for the platform: in short, we had to expand Ushahidi to allow for 3-level hierarchical categorization and multiple locations for an Institution's profile. The work has resulted in a platform, which is now public and managed by MEST
